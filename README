Multiping plugin can send pings to several hosts at once and display
thir round trip time and host status - it indicates lossless
connection, packet loss and unreachable host with green, red or dark
LED lights.

Installation:

    make
    make install (as root)

--- SECURITY WARNING ---

Multiping needs to open a raw socket for sending and receiving of the
ICMP packets. For this reason, it consists of two parts - GKrellM
plugin with normal privileges, and helper application (pinger), which
is based on the code of linux "ping" and which starts with superuser
privileges. However, these privileges are dropped immediately, so even
in the case of a security flaw in the code, the attacker can gain at
most the access to the raw socket and the should not be able to
compromise the system.
